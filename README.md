<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to my Python-Tutorials repo. Kudos on your decision to embrace and master Python programming language. It is one of the mostly used programming languages by beginners because of its simplicity. This tutorial will cover almost all the fundamental topics in Python. However, the GUI part will be handled in a separate repo. Relax and grab your bag of popcorns for the fascinating adventure that awaits you!</p> 
		
This tutorial is composed of many topics which shall be updated from time to time. They are as listed and described below:
